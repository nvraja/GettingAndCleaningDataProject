# Wearable Computing - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The code in this project cleanes and prepares the data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and stores the tidy data into comma seperated (";") text files. For further information on the structure of the tidy data files please have a look at CookBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations.

How to use:

1. Download sample data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Unzip downloaded file into the R working directory containing the R program run_analysis.R.

3. Run code.

4. Possibly use cleaned data files tidy_data.txt or tidy_data_2.txt for further analysis.
